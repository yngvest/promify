# Promify

Chrome extension to prettify your PromQL queries.

## How to use

The extension adds a 'Promify' button to Chrome context menu. Select your query, click 'Promify' and paste pretty query from clipboard.

2. Open *Extensions* page in Chrome
3. Enable Developer Mode by toggling button in top-right corner
4. Drag and drop the '.crx' extension file onto the Extensions page 
5. Install


#### Why not Chrome Store?

This project is more of a demo than a fully-fledged extension. It doesn't quite meet my quality standards for publishing it to the extension store.
